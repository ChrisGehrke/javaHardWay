  <h1>The difference between switch and if/else statements</h1>
  <p>
   A switch statement looks through a list of cases until it finds a match.
   Once it finds a match it will run the code until it hits a break statement.
   From what I have read is that the switch works much faster and is useful
   for things like programming a calendar and how many days are in the month.

   An if/else statement is where you take a true/false statement and put
   it in the body of the "if" statement. The code will execut everything
   in the condition of the "if" statment if it meets the criteria. If
   the statement is false it will skip it until it finds a true "if"
   statement or runs into an "else" statement. The "else" statement will
   run if none of the "if" statments are true and will give an alternative.
   I think of it sort of like an "if this - then that" kind of coding.

   I see a main difference between these statments is that if/else statements
   are more complex in conditions while switch statments look for a constant.
   I read that more programers use switch more often because it is faster
   and more readable.
