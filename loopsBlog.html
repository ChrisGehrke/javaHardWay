  <h1>For, while, and do-while loops</h1>
  <p>
   The for loop will repeat a variable until a particular condition is met.
   Once the condition is met the program will stop repeating itself. You
   could also say that the for statement will keep running as long as
   it is true and terminates when it is false. You could use this statement
   printing numbers 1-10 and terminating when the number reaches 11.

   While and do-while loops can be used interchangably. The difference
   between the two is that a while loop will test the condition at the
   beginning of the code. A do-while loop will test the condition at
   the end of the code. While loops are more common because it wont
   have to run the code if the condition is met versus having
   to keep running the code over and over until the condition is met.

   Do-whiles are used when you want the user to enter a specific answer
   and it will keep running the same question until the answer is correct.
   The while loop in that case would require either duplicate codes or
   extra conditions in order for the computer to enter into the
   question before the user can answer.
