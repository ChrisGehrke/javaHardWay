  <h1>Using void</h1>
  <p>
   The keyword void tells the compiler that the keyword main() does
   not return a value. Without void you could write something like
   int to return a value. Void is just a return type that basically
   is saying "this method returns nothing." Void is used often because
   you're not usually going to be returning a value from the top level (class).
