  <h1>Parameter vs Argument</h1>
  <p>
   An argument is either a variable or an expression that holds an integer
   value. A parameter is what an argument is stored in. A parameter is
   when a variable is declared. So you can say an argument is the value while
   the parameter is the variable.

   I've also read that a parameter is a variable that declares a function,
   while an argument is the actual value of this variable that gets
   passed to function.

   I see it as the argument could be that my crayon is red and the parameter
   could be I'm only allowed to use red crayon to draw on this
   sheet of paper.
